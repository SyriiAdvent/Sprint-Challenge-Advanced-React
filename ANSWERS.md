- [X] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
  - Theres no real beneficial gain to using them unless its personal preference. there not "better" then hooks. If your project uses a old code
  base then you might want to stick to classes to keep consistency across the project
- [X] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
  - Mounting, Updating, Unmounting. The 3 words are kind of self explanitory. Add "Component" after each of those 3 words
- [X] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
  - To use it modulary across multiple usecases. (very powerful imo)
- [X] Why is it important to test our apps?
  - To gian confidence in our shipped product (code)
